# Writing Maintainable Rails Applications.
A presention I gave at the February 2023 DevEdmonton JavaScript/Ruby [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/edmontonunlimited/events/290932435/).  This presentation outlines what I think makes an application maintainable with a focus on some Ruby on Rails applications.  You can find the slides [here]().  You can find additional [Dev Edmonton](https://devedmonton.com/) presentations, including ones I've given, on the Dev Edmonton YouTube [Channel](https://www.youtube.com/DevEdmonton).
